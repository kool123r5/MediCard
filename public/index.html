        <h1>What is medicard?</h1>
        <h3>Medicard is a simple card that contains all of a patient's information. It is often difficult for doctors to acquire crucial information on a patient when they enter an ER. It becomes quite difficult as a result of this. This will be fully changed by Medicard. All of the information about the patients will be conveniently accessible using medicard. The patient's card will contain information on previous hospital visits, allergies, and past medicines. Doctors will benefit greatly from this card because they will now have access to all of the patient's information with just a quick scan. This makes the lives of both patients and doctors considerably easier.</h3>

        <h1>How do you use it?</h1>

        <h3>To utilise it, you must first create an account. After that, you must fill in some personal information such as contact or assistance numbers, as well as your residence. The doctors can then scan the code and gain access to all of your allergies, prescriptions, and previous hospital visits when you go to the hospital. This will make prescribing medications much easy for them. It will also be a fantastic area for the patient to see all of the medications they require, ensuring that nothing is forgotten. It will also be a good place for the patient to see all the medicines they have to have that way they dont miss anything.</h3>

        <h1>Our mission</h1>

        <h3>Our goal is to make the lives of doctors easier and to save them time. We hope to change the way medical records are collected. The number of deaths in the emergency room will be reduced as a result of this.</h3>
